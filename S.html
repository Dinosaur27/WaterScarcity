<center><h1><p> Possible solutions</p></h1></center>
  <justify><h3><p> This crisis seems to be growing with no intentions of stopping. In order to ensure at least a couple of more years of water supply, there are some precautions to be taken until a permanent solution is found. There are many possible solutions for this issue, and some of them are:</p></h3></justify>
    <h3>
  <li> Educate the community of such issue and encourage them to reduce ones over consumption of water.
    </li>
    <li> Discuss with water workers the implementation of a limited water usage in each property in an equative portion for each consumer.
    </li>
    <li> Work with professionals to create a water collection system, that collects rainwater to later be purified in case any natural disaster hits the country, there’s clean and safe water available.
    </li>
  <li> Work hand in hand with the government to provide funds that support the communities on these solutions.
  </li>
    <li>	Encourage people to help in any way they deem possible, not only for their benefit but for others as well.
    </li>
    <li> Improve our groundwater supply by creating new infrastructures that could contain vast amounts of water.
    </li> </h3>
  <center><h1> <p> What are the risks? </p</h1></center>
    
    <justify><h3><p>Like any plan of action there is always risks involved. If some of these solutions go south and water scarcity continues to grow, there is a possibility that families could die form the lack of water source. The agriculture could be deemed permanently affected by this rising issue, and wildlife along with the ecosystem would be in danger. Since water is the base of existence, without it, earth itself could now be in danger from the unstoppable increase in climate change and global warming.</p> 

<p>
    In order to decrease the chances of these risks from occurring, we should encourage people to take more care of the environment. By creating a foundation in people’s knowledge of this topic, we can ensure the cooperation of the community by helping create a routine to keep the environment clean.
  </p> </h3></justify>

  <center><h1><p>What resources are needed?</p></h1></center>
    <justify><h3><p>Now that we have laid a foundation based on facts, we can move forward with a hypothetical plan of action. In order to build these infrastructures, we need tools, some of the tools needed are:</p>
   <li> Vast supply of water tanks
    </li>
  <li> Functioning pipelines</li>
    <li>
      Aqueduct professionals
    </li>
    <li>
      Political support and power
    </li>
    <li>
      Engineers
    </li>
    <li>
      Scientists
    </li>
    <li>
      Architectures
    </li>
    <li>
      Volunteers
    </li>
    <li>Building strategies</li>
    <li> Team effort</li> </h3></justify>
    <center><h1><p>Conclusion</p></h1></center>
    <justify><h3><p>Based on the information found we can conclude that water scarcity is a global issue that stems from poor government management affecting the political system. Because of this, places like Iraq, Egypt, Africa, and other places around the world lose most of their resources due to the lack of supervision, in which case it affects many aspects of life causing innocent people to die. To finalize, we can say that by helping the world’s state, we are saving ourselves from water scarcity.</p></h3></justify>
