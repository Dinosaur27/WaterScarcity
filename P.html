 <center> <h1> <p>What is the cause of this? </p></h1></center>
 <h3><p>  There are many causes for water scarcity but some of the most impactful ones are the following:

<justify><li>The overpopulation in countries, causing the overuse of water, in which case resources become scarce as we continue to over consume it.</li>
      
<li>Natural calamities such as droughts and floods, contaminate our water supply making it unsafe to be used for any kind of consumption.</li>
      
<li>Climate change, as the levels rise it alters almost every stage of the water cycle, causing a decrease in the water supply.</li>
      
<li>While farming is a victim of water scarcity, it is also the cause of it. The excessive use of water for the crops affects the water supply.</li>
    </p>

  <p>
As water scarcity continues to grow, many countries find themselves at risk of absolute water scarcity by 2025. As a result of this, countries have reached the point of negotiations through treaties and agreements to share water supply. For example, India and Pakistan have what is called the Indus Waters Treaty which is a treaty that agrees that both countries cooperate and exchange information regarding the use of the Western Rivers (Indus, Jhelum, Chenab) and the Eastern Rivers (Ravi, Beas, Sutlej). This was implemented after many disputes and disagreements between the two countries were seen by the World Bank regarding the necessity of water.
