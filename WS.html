Water scarcity is a worldwide health crisis that affects areas where water was previously hard to come by. Nearly one million people die from sanitation and hygiene related diseases each year. Water as we all know, is a very important part of survival since it provides a way to maintain a healthy hygiene, hydration, and the production of agriculture for our consumption. Today, around 771 million people lack access to safe water, but what causes this growing problem? Observe the video for a better understanding of this issue.
